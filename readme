## README

This README provides an overview of the steps involved in processing and analyzing various datasets. It includes information on the order of code execution and the tasks that need to be accomplished. The aim is to automate the processes using bash scripts for convenience.

### Step 1: Landscape mapping

**Order of code execution:**
1. `split_raster.ipynb`
2. `batch_fragstats`
3. `rename_to_csv.sh`
4. `combine_metrics.ipynb`

**To do:**
- Convert all the code files into a bash script that runs all the processes automatically.

### Step 2: ASOS

**Order of code execution:**
1. `format_asos_data.ipynb`

**To do:**
- Convert `format_asos_data.ipynb` into a bash script.

### Step 3: NEXRAD L3 data

**To do:**
- Write a bash script for processing NEXRAD L3 data.

### Step 4: Combine data

**To do:**
- Write a bash script that combines all the datasets together into a single dataset ready for analysis.

Please note that the provided information is a summary of the steps and tasks involved. It's important to refer to the actual code files for more detailed instructions and implementation specifics.
